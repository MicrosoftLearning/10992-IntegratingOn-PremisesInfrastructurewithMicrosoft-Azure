2.   From the **C10992B0701-LabAA** blade, import the F:\\Allfiles\\Mod07\\Labfiles\\New-10992Workflow.ps1 script as a Windows PowerShell workflow-based runbook.
3.   Review the content of the workflow, and then publish the runbook.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully created an OMS workspace. You should have also added the Azure Automation &amp; Control solution to your workspace, created a new Azure Automation account and imported a sample Windows PowerShell Workflow-based runbook.


## Exercise 2: Configuring an on-premises computer as a Hybrid Runbook Worker
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you have configured all the Azure components that are necessary to perform your tests, it is time to configure your on-premises test computer. You will need to install the Microsoft Management Agent so that your test computer can communicate with OMS and the Automation account. You will also need to install the runbook environment and connect it to Azure Automation. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Install the Microsoft Management Agent on the lab virtual machine
2.   Install the runbook environment and connect to Azure Automation


#### Task 1: Install the Microsoft Management Agent on the lab virtual machine
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, sign in to your Azure subscription as the Service Administrator by running `Add-AzureRmAccount`
2.   From the the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, type in the following command, and then press Enter (replace `<workspace_name>` with the name of the Log Analytics workspace you created earlier in this lab):
```
Set-AzureRmOperationalInsightsIntelligencePack -ResourceGroupName 10992B0701-LabRG -WorkspaceName -IntelligencePackName "AzureAutomation" -Enabled $true
```
3.   On MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the **Microsoft Operations Management Suite** portal, navigate to the **Connected Sources** pane of the **Settings** page.

## Exercise 3: Running a runbook on a Hybrid Runbook Worker and examining the outcome
  
### Scenario
  
Finally, with all the components in place, you are ready to perform your testing. You will start the sample runbook from the on-premises lab virtual machine and then initiate its execution from the Azure portal. You will examine results of both of these actions. Finally, to minimize the cost of your testing, you will identify and delete all the Azure resources that you created in this lab.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Start the runbook from the lab virtual machine
2.   Start the runbook from the Azure portal
3.   Examine the outcome of the runbook execution
4.   Identify and delete all lab Azure resources


#### Task 1: Start the runbook from the lab virtual machine
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, start the Azure automation runbook `Write-10992HelloWorld` with the parameter `Name='AdatumLabWorld (local)'` on MIA-CL1 by running the following command:

```
Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook -AutomationAccountName C10992B0701-LabAA -Name Write-10992HelloWorld -RunOn 10992B0701-LabWG -ResourceGroupName 10992B0701-LabRG -Parameters @{Name='AdatumLabWorld (local)'}
```


#### Task 2: Start the runbook from the Azure portal
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, switch to the Internet Explorer window displaying the Azure portal, and then from the **C10992B0701-LabAA** blade, start the **Write-10992HelloWorld** runbook with the following settings:

  -   Parameters NAME: **AdatumLabWorld (from the Azure Portal)**
  -   Run on: **Hybrid Worker**
  -   Choose Hybrid Worker group: **10992B0701-LabWG**.

2.   Monitor the job status as it changes from **Queued** through **Started** and to **Completed**. Verify that there were no errors or warnings.


#### Task 3: Examine the outcome of the runbook execution
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Azure portal, view the listing of jobs executed in the previous tasks of this exercise.
2.   View the streams generated by the most recent job.


#### Task 4: Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Azure portal, navigate to the **Resource groups** blade.
2.   From the **Resource group** blade, delete the **10992B0701-LabRG** resource group
