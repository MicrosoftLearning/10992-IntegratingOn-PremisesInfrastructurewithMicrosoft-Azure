> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully created an Azure virtual machine and an Azure web app and deployed an existing web app to both of them by using Visual Studio.


## Exercise 2: Creating and configuring an Azure Traffic Manager profile
  
#### Task 1: Create a Traffic Manager profile
  
1.   On  MIA-CL1, switch to the Azure portal and click **+ Create a resource**.
2.   On the **New** blade, in the **Search the Marketplace** text box, type **Traffic Manager profile** and then press Enter.

  -   Routing method: **Performance**
  -   Subscription: the name of your Azure subscription
  -   Resource group: in the drop down list, click **10992B0601-LabRG**. 
  -   Resource group location: specify the same Azure region to which you deployed the Azure VM in the first exercise of this lab

6.   Click **Create** and wait until the Traffic Manager profile is provisioned. This should take less than a minute.


#### Task 2: Configure Traffic Manager
  
1.   In the Azure portal, in the hub menu, click **All services**.
2.   In the **Filter** text box, type **Traffic Manager profiles** and then, in the list of results, click **Traffic Manager profiles**.

4.   On the traffic manager profile blade, click **Configuration**.
5.   In the traffic manager profile configuration blade, set the entry in the **DNS time to live (TTL)** box to **30** and press Enter.
6.   Click **Save**.
7.   On the traffic manager profile blade, click **Endpoints**.
8.   On the traffic manager endpoints blade, click **+ Add**.
9.   On the **Add endpoint** blade, ensure that the **Azure endpoint** appears in the **Type** list.
10.   In the **Name** text box, type the name of the web app that you created in the previous exercise.
11.   In the **Target resource type** drop-down list of websites, click **App Service**.
12.   Click **Choose an app service**.
13.   On the **Resource** blade, click the web app that you created in the previous exercise.
14.   On the **Add endpoint** blade, click **OK**. 
15.   On the **Endpoints** blade, click **Add**.
16.   On the **Add endpoint** blade, ensure that **Azure endpoint** appears in the **Type** list.

  > **Note:** If you were adding an on-premises web app with a public IP address, then you would select **External endpoint** instead. You would also need to provide the corresponding fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and location by specifying the closest Azure region.

17.   In the **Name** box, type **10992B0601-vm1**.
18.   In the **Target resource type** drop-down list, click **Public IP address**.
19.   Click **Target resource Choose a public IP address**.
20.   On the **Resource** blade, click the public IP address named **10992B0601-vm1-ip**, which is assigned to the network interface of the virtual machine that you created in the previous exercise.
21.   On the **Add endpoint** blade, click **OK**. 
22.   Monitor the Traffic Manager profile endpoints blade and wait until the monitoring status of both endpoints is **Online**.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully created a Traffic Manager profile with two endpoints representing the Azure web app instance and the public IP address of the network interface attached to the Azure virtual machine.


## Exercise 3: Testing Traffic Manager failover functionality
  
#### Task 1: Test Traffic Manager routing to the web app
  
1.   On  MIA-CL1, click the **Command Prompt** taskbar icon.
2.   In the **Command Prompt** window, type the following command (replace `<traffic_manager_profile>` with the unique name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile), and then press Enter:

```
nslookup <traffic_manager_profile>.trafficmanager.net
```

3.   Notice the output of the command. The **Name** entry in the output should contain the name assigned to the public IP of the network interface attached to the virtual machine.

  > **Note:** This is the expected outcome, because you selected the **Performance** routing method of the Traffic Manager profile. According to the lab setup, the Azure virtual machine resides in the Azure region closer to you. This would also be the case if this virtual machine was representing your on-premises web server.

4.   Switch to the Azure portal that displays the Traffic Manager profile blade.
5.   On the blade, click **Overview**. 
6.   Click the link listed below the **DNS name** entry that contains the name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile. This should automatically open another page in the Internet Explorer window, displaying the Adatum web app home page of the Adatum Web site running in the virtual machine. 
7.   Leave the new Internet Explorer page open.


#### Task 2: Shut down the virtual machine and test Traffic Manager routing
  
1.   Switch to the Internet Explorer page displaying the Azure portal and, in the hub menu, click **Virtual machines**.
2.   On the **Virtual machines** blade, click the ellipsis to the right of the **10992B0601-vm1** entry, and, in the drop-down menu, click **Stop**.
3.   When prompted whether to stop **'10992B0601-vm1'**, click **Yes.** Wait until the virtual machine is in the **Stopped (deallocated)** state.
4.   Switch back to the browser window that shows the Adatum web app home page, and then click **Contact**. The connection should time out, because, with the current settings, it takes more than a minute for the failover to take effect. 
5.   Switch to the Internet Explorer page displaying the Azure portal and navigate to the Traffic Manager profile blade. 
6.   On the Traffic Manager profile blade review the **MONITOR STATUS** column of the Traffic Manager endpoints. Ensure that the endpoint representing the Azure VM is listed with the **Degraded** status. If that is not the case, wait for about one minute and click **Refresh**. 
7.   Switch to the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, re-type the following command (replace `<traffic_manager_profile>` with the unique name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile), and then press Enter:

```
nslookup <traffic_manager_profile>.trafficmanager.net
```

8.   Take a note of the output of the command. At this point, the **Name** entry should represent the name assigned to the Azure web app.
9.   Switch to the Internet Explorer window. Click the cogwheel icon in its upper right corner. In the drop down menu, click **Safety**, and then in the cascading menu, click **InPrivate Browsing**.
10.   In the URL box, type **http://`<traffic_manager_profile>`.trafficmanager.net** where `<traffic_manager_profile>` represents the unique name that you assigned to the Traffic Manager profile. Press Enter.
11.   Notice that you can successfully access the Adatum web app home page again. Traffic Manager automatically redirected you to the Azure web app instance.

  > **Note:** The Traffic Manager profile facilitates automatic failover regardless of the routing method.


#### Task 3: Identify and delete all lab Azure resources.
  
1.   On  MIA-CL1, switch to the Azure portal. 
2.   In the hub vertical menu on the left, click **Resource Groups**.
3.   On the **Resource groups** blade, click **10992B0601-LabRG**. 
4.   On the **10992B0601-LabRG** blade, click **Delete**. 
5.   On the **Are you sure you want to delete "10992B0601-LabRG"?** blade, type the name of the resource group in the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** box, and then click **Delete**.
6.   Close all open windows.


#### Task 4: Prepare for the next lab
  
After you have completed this lab, revert the virtual machines in preparation for the next lab: 

1.   On the host computer, start Microsoft Hyper-V Manager.
2.   In the Virtual Machines list, right-click **10992B-MIA-CL1**, and then click **Revert**.
3.   In the **Revert Virtual Machine** dialog box, click **Revert**.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully tested the normal operations of Traffic Manager configured with the performance routing method. You should also have successfully verified that Traffic Manager can detect the failure of one of its endpoints and automatically redirect traffic to the remaining one by altering the outcome of the DNS name resolution.
