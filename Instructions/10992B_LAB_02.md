  -   Virtual hard disk size: **1 GB**
  -   Virtual hard disk format: **VHDX**
  -   Virtual hard disk type: **Dynamically expanding**

4.   Detach the newly created disk.
5.   Close **Computer Management**.


#### Task 3: Convert the VHDX virtual disk to the VHD format
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
2.   From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, use the **Convert-VHD** cmdlet to convert the .vhdx disk file into the VHD format.
3.   Wait until the conversion completes. This should take a few seconds

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully created an Azure storage account, created a fixed .vhdx virtual disk file, and converted it to the VHD format.


## Exercise 2: Uploading a virtual disk file to Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you converted the virtual disk file to the VHD format and created an Azure storage account, you are ready to upload the .vhd file. You will accomplish this by using the AzCopy.exe utility.

A. Datum Corporation wants to minimize the cost associated with testing Azure capabilities. You need to identify and delete all the resources you deploy during your tests.

## Exercise 2: Deploying a private Docker Registry in Azure
  
### Scenario
  
Now that you have successfully implemented a Docker host in an on-premises Hyper-V virtual machine and in an Azure virtual machine, you want to test the setup and image deployment by using a private Docker Registry in Azure. To simplify your tests, you will use a small, sample hello-world image available from the Docker Hub Registry. You will start by creating a private registry hosted in an Azure storage account. You will then download the sample image to your lab computer and upload it to the newly created private registry. Finally, you will deploy the image from the private registry to both the Azure and the on-premises Docker hosts.

Because A. Datum Corporation wants to minimize the cost associated with testing Azure capabilities, you will identify and delete all the resources you deploy during your tests.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Create an Azure Container Registry
2.   Identify Azure Container Registry authentication settings.
3.   Push an image to Azure Container Registry.
4.   Download and deploy images from the Azure Container Registry
5.   Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
6.   Prepare for the next lab


#### Task 1: Create an Azure Container Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Internet Explorer window, in the Azure portal, create a new **Azure Container Registry** with the following settings:

  -   Registry name: a unique name consisting of between 5 and 50 alphanumeric characters
  -   Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab
  -   Resource group: create a new resource group named **10992B0203-LabRG**
  -   Location : select any Azure location where you can create an Azure Container Registry, preferably the same one hosting the Azure VM you deployed earlier in this exercise
  -   Admin user: **Enable** (this allows you to use the registry name as username and admin user access key as password to access the registry)
  -   SKU : **Basic**

2.   Wait for the operation to complete.


#### Task 2: Identify Azure Container Registry authentication settings.
  
1.   In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the Azure container registry you created in the previous task.
2.   On the container registry blade, copy the container registry password to Clipboard. 
3.   Note the values of the **Username** and the **Login server** entries. The username should match the registry name and the login server name should consist of the registry name followed by the **.azurecr.io** suffix.


#### Task 3: Push an image to Azure Container Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, log in to the Azure Container registry you created in the first task by running the `docker login` command, providing the value of the `login-server` parameter you identified in the previous task as well as the following parameters:

  - `--username`: **Username** you identified in the previous task
  - `--password`: **password** you copied to Clipboard in the previous task

2.   Ensure that you receive the **Login succeeded** message. Next, pull the **microsoft/aci-helloworld** image from Docker Hub by running the `docker pull` command from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window. 
3.   Wait for the image to be downloaded to the Docker Azure VM. Next, tag the image with the Azure Container registry name by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker tag` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified in the previous task.
4.   Push the tagged image to the Azure Container registry by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker push` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified in the previous task.
5.   Wait for the image to be pushed to the registry. Next, in the Azure portal, from the container registry blade, verify that the Azure Container registry contains the **aci-helloworld** repository


#### Task 4: Download and deploy images from the private Docker Registry
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, pull the newly tagged image from the Azure Container registry, by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker pull` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified earlier in this exercise.
2.   Note that the image does not need to be downloaded, since it is already present on the target Docker Azure VM. 
3.   Deploy the image downloaded from the Azure Container registry, by running from the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window the `docker run` command with the `<login-server>/aci-helloworld:v1` parameter, replacing the `<login-server>` entry with the value you identified earlier in this exercise. Deploy the web service running in the container such that it is accessible via port **8080**. 
4.   Run the `docker ps` command to verify that the image has been successfully deployed.
5.   Note that the output includes the tagged image. 
6.   To access the running container, switch to the Internet Explorer window displaying the **Welcome to nginx!** page, and change the target port to **8080**. Verify that the **Welcome to Azure Container Instances** page is being displayed.


#### Task 5: Identify and delete all lab Azure resources
  
1.   From the Azure portal, delete the **10992B0202-LabRG** resource group.
2.   From the Azure portal, delete the **10992B0203-LabRG** resource group
3.   Close all open windows.


#### Task 6: Prepare for the next lab
  
After you have completed this lab, revert the virtual machines in preparation for the next lab: 

1.   On the host computer, start Microsoft Hyper-V Manager.
2.   In the Virtual Machines list, right-click **10992B-MIA-CL1**, and then click **Revert**.
3.   In the **Revert Virtual Machine** dialog box, click **Revert**.

> **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you should have successfully deployed a private Docker registry in Azure.


  
**Question**
