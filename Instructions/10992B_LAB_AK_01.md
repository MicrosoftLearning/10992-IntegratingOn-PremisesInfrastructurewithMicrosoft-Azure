4.   In the Azure portal, in the hub menu on the left hand side, click **+ Create a resource**. 
5.   On the **New** blade, click **Compute** and then click **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**.
6.   On the **Basics** tab, specify the following settings, and then click **Next: Disks >**:

  -   Subscription: type the name of your Azure subscription you will be using for this lab
  -   Resource group: click **Create new** and type **10992B0101-LabRG** as the name of the new resource group
  -   Virtual machine name: **10992B0101-vm1**
  -   Region: select the name of an Azure region where you have the ability to provision Azure VMs
  -   Availability options: **No infrastructure redundancy required**

7.   On the **Disks** tab, specify the following settings, and then click **Next: Networking >**:

  -   Under **Disk Options**, for the OS disk type: **Standard HDD**
  -   Click **Advanced**, and set Use managed disks: **Yes**
  
8.   On the **Networking** tab, specify the following settings, and then click **Next: Management >**:

  -   Virtual network: accept the default value, which creates a new virtual network
  -   Subnet: accept the default setting, which creates a new subnet named **default**
  -   Public IP address: accept the default value, which will create a new public IP address
  -   NIC network security group: accept the default values, which will create a new Basic network security group allowing access via RDP *(The setting from the Basics tab.)*
  -   Accelerated networking: **Off**
  -   Load balancing: **No**

6.   Review the content of the script. Note that the purpose of the script is to provision another virtual machine into the same Azure region and of the same size as the virtual machine you deployed in the previous exercise by using the Azure portal.
7.   In the script, replace the `<subscription-name>` placeholder with the name of your Azure subscription.
8.   Click **File**, and then click **Save** to save the changes.
9.   Click **Debug**, and then click **Run/Continue** to execute the script.
10.   When prompted, type in the credentials of the user account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription, and then click **Sign in**.
11.   Do not wait for the deployment to complete, but instead proceed to the next exercise.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully deployed an Azure VM by using Azure PowerShell.


## Exercise 3: Deploying an Azure VM by using Azure CLI 
  
#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using Azure CLI
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, right-click the **Command Prompt** shortcut on the taskbar, in the pop-up menu, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then, in the right-click menu, click **Run as administrator**. 
2.   From **Administrator: Command Prompt**, type the following command and then press Enter:

```
az login
```

3.   You will be presented with the message instructing you to open a browser at the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and provide the code included in the message to authenicate. Start Internet Explorer and browse to https://aka.ms/devicelogin. 
4.   On the **Device Login** page, type the code included in the message. This will identify Microsoft Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface as the application attempting to authenticate. Click **Continue**. 
5.   In the sign-in windows that appears, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.
6.   Note the message stating that you have signed in to the Microsoft Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface application on your device. Close the Internet Explorer window.
7.   If you have multiple subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, to identify the subscription in which you are going to create a new Azure VM, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
az account show
```

8.   Note the value of the `id` property for each subscription in the output of the previous command. To specify the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual machine, type the following command and then press Enter (replace `<subscription_id>` with the value of the `id` property of that subscription):

```
az account set --subscription "<subscription_id>"
```

9.   To identify the Azure region to which you deployed the Azure VMs in the previous exercise, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
az vm list --query "[?contains(name,'10992B')].location" --output tsv
```

10.   To identify the size of the Azure VMs you deployed in the previous exercises, type the following command, and then press Enter:

```
az vm list --query "[?contains(name,'10992B')].hardwareProfile.vmSize" --output tsv
```

11.   Create a new resource group in the same Azure region by typing the following and pressing Enter (replace `<location>` with the name of the Azure region you identified in step 9):

```
az group create --name 10992B0103-LabRG --location <location>
```

12.   Create a virtual network in the same location as the resource group by typing the following and pressing Enter:

```
az network vnet create --resource-group 10992B0103-LabRG --name 10992B0103-LabRG-vnet --address-prefix 10.1.0.0/20 --subnet-name default --subnet-prefix 10.1.0.0/24
```

13.   Create a network security group that will contain an rule allowing RDP connectivity by typing the following and pressing Enter:

```
az network nsg create --resource-group 10992B0103-LabRG --name 10992B0103-vm3-nsg
```

14.   Create an RDP allow rule in the newly created network security group by typing the following and pressing Enter:

```
az network nsg rule create --resource-group 10992B0103-LabRG --nsg-name 10992B0103-vm3-nsg --name default-allow-rdp --protocol tcp --priority 1000 --destination-port-range 3389 --access allow
```

15.   Create a public IP address by typing the following and pressing Enter:

```
az network public-ip create --resource-group 10992B0103-LabRG --name 10992B0103-vm3-ip
```

16.   Create a network interface card by typing the following and pressing Enter:

```
az network nic create --resource-group 10992B0103-LabRG --name 10992B0103-vm3-nic --vnet-name 10992B0103-LabRG-vnet --subnet default --public-ip-address 10992B0103-vm3-ip --network-security-group 10992B0103-vm3-nsg
```

17.   Create a new Azure VM by typing the following and pressing Enter (make sure to replace `<location>` and `<vmsize>` with the Azure region and VM size you identified in step 9 and 10, respectively):

```
az vm create --resource-group 10992B0103-LabRG --name 10992B0103-vm3 --location <location> --nics 10992B0103-vm3-nic --image win2016datacenter --size <vmsize> --admin-username Student --admin-password Pa55w.rd1234
```

18.   Do not wait for the deployment to complete, but instead proceed to the next exercise.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you should have successfully deployed an Azure VM by using Azure CLI.
